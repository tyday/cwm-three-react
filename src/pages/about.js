      Iâ€™m Joel Chaney, founder of Chaney Wealth Management. 
      I have 24 years of experience in providing sound, objective advice to investors looking for guidance with their financial decision-making. 
      I work closely with you to develop a custom, comprehensive plan that helps you pursue your goals with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
      I listen to you carefully to ensure that the financial plan we create together aligns with your values, investment philosophy, risk tolerance,
      and both your short and long-term objectives. 
      To make certain you remain on course, we meet regularly to discuss changes in your life and how to best support them with smart financial planning. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I understand that your wealth represents what you have accomplished in the past and your aspirations for the future,
      and I take my role helping you grow and preserve your financial assets very seriously. 
      I pride myself in my accessibility, in regard to time and temperament. 
      I am responsive, easy to talk with, and am genuinely invested in helping you.
